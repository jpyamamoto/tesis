> To know the meaning of a (declarative) sentence is to know what the world would have to be like for the sentence to be true. Put another way, to give the meaning of a sentence is to specify its truth conditions, i.e., to give necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of that sentence

<mark style="background-color: #88d7ff">Quote</mark>
> Frege's Principle or the Principle of Compositionality.

<mark style="background-color: #88d7ff">Quote</mark>
> The meaning of the whole is a function of the meaning of the parts and their mode of combination

<mark style="background-color: #88d7ff">Quote</mark>
> the Principle of Compositionality seems to us to be supported by considerations much like those which reveal the existence of phrase structure in syntax

<mark style="background-color: #88d7ff">Quote</mark>
> Model-Theoretic Semantics

<mark style="background-color: #88d7ff">Quote</mark>
> A model begins by specifying what sorts of thing there are in the world, and then, with respect to this assumed ontology, specifies an interpretation of the object language.

<mark style="background-color: #88d7ff">Quote</mark>
> logically true and another as logically false; specifically, these will be sentences which are true or false, respectively, in every model

<mark style="background-color: #88d7ff">Quote</mark>
> Possible Worlds Semantics

<mark style="background-color: #88d7ff">Quote</mark>
> the intuitive significance of a possible world is that of a complete specification of how things are, or might be, down to the finest semantically relevant detail
